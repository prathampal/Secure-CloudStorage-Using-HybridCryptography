Implementing Secure Cloud Storae and Access Using Hybrid Cryptography

Proposed System:
To ensure the security of cloud data, one effective approach
is to employ cryptographic algorithms to safeguard
information from potential eavesdroppers. A recommended
best practice for enhancing the security of cloud data
involves the use of hybrid encryption, which combines both
symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. Among the available
options, the AES cryptography algorithm stands out as an
optimal choice due to its speed, popularity, and widespread
adoption, especially in light of the increasing computing
power available. In contrast, the ECC asymmetric algorithm
is a favorable option for its low power consumption and
improved computational efficiency, requiring a minimal key
length of 160 bits to achieve an equivalent level of security
as a 1024-bit RSA encryption.
